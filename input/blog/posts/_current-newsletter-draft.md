## General news

* [**Calling all Maintainers - OSS Maintainer Support Survey**](https://seankilleen.com/2022/01/announcing-the-net-oss-maintainer-support-survey/): Sean Killeen ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/sjkilleen), [GitHub](https://github.com/SeanKilleen)) has created a survey to help identify ways maintainers and contributors would prefer to be supported and how supported they currently feel in each regard. He will share the aggregate data with the larger community and hopes this will help prioritize efforts to engage the community to support maintainers. If you maintain or contribute to an OSS project, [fill out the survey and make your voice heard](https://seankilleen.com/2022/01/announcing-the-net-oss-maintainer-support-survey/)!

### New Releases
#### Chem4Word Version 3.2 going into Beta Testing.
We've been quiet on [Chem4Word](https://www.chem4word.co.uk) lately. But we're very pleased to announce that version 3.2 is going into beta testing! This point release doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is. For years now our users have been asking for it to support chemical _reactions_. Chemistry is most interesting when it's about _change_, and reactions are at the centre of that. So we've been working hard, albeit quietly, to bring this about. Here's a typical reaction scheme (the production of aspirin):

Needless to say, this is all completely [CML](https://www.xml-cml.org/) compliant! We strongly support open science and the sharing of scientific information.

We're on the lookout for beta testers, so if anyone wants to get involved, please contact [Clyde Davies](mailto:clyde@chem4word.co.uk?subject=Beta%20Testing)
