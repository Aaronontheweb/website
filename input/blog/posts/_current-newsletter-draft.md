It uses already familiar tools and implements best practices around them to provide you a SOLID development experience. ASP.NET Boilerplate works with the latest ASP.NET Core & EF Core but also supports ASP.NET MVC 5.x & EF 6.x as well.|


### New Releases

#### [DotVVM 3.1 Released](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/85/Released-DotVVM-3-1)
If you haven't heard about DotVVM yet - it's a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) framework which you can use to [build ASP.NET Core web apps with just C# and HTML]([DotVVM](https://www.dotvvm.com/build), or to [modernize ASP.NET Web Forms apps to .NET 6](https://www.dotvvm.com/modernize). DotVVM is based on Knockout JS, its download size is just about 60kB, and it comes with a set of ready-made UI controls like GridView, FileUpload, and more.

**DotVVM 3.1** brings a better support for lambdas in data-binding expressions, and you can now use LINQ methods in data-binding which helps with client-side filtering in grids and lists. There are also a lot of bug fixes and smaller improvements.
