## General news



## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### [Project Spotlight](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/spotlight)

### New Projects


### New Releases

#### [Oqtane 2.0.1 Released](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/546/oqtane-201-now-available)

Since releasing version 2.0 in coordination with the .NET 5 launch event at .NET Conf in November 2020, the exciting new modular application framework for Blazor has continued to mature and gain momentum. This release includes a variety of performance and user experience impovements for both users and developers. A total of 101 pull requests were merged from 9 different contributors, pushing the total number of project commits all-time over 1600. The 2.0.1 release is available for download on 
[Github](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework/releases/tag/v2.0.1).

### [NUnit](https://nunit.org)

[NUnit Analyzers 3.1 and 2.1](https://github.com/nunit/nunit.analyzers/releases/tag/3.1.0) are available. The 3.1 version continues to enhance the experience of using NUnit with the C# 8 Nullable Reference Types feature. (The 3.x versions have additional features that only work in Visual Studio 2019 and newer. The 2.x versions are available for those using Visual Studio 2017.)

[NUnit Adapter 4.0.0-beta.2](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/vs-test-adapter/Adapter-Release-Notes.html#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-400-beta2---april-6-2021) resolves some issues and improves performance. A major change in this version is the upgrade of the NUnit.Engine to version 3.12, and thus Mono.Cecil is no longer used. Instead it has a reduced version (based on Mono.Cecil) packed into TestCentric.engine.metadata doing the same job with navigation data.

## How to Get Involved
The .NET Foundation is only as good as the community that supports it. There are many ways to get involved. 

### [Support a project](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects)
Projects, and the people behind them, are at the heart of what .NET Foundation is all about.

[Browse our projects](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects) to find out how to contribute. 

### [Become a member](https://dotnetfoundation.org/member) 
By involving people that are passionate about .NET we can create a powerful organization that furthers sustainable open source, a diverse and open community, and help evolve this growing and evolving ecosystem that we are very passionate about. If you are as passionate about the .NET ecosystem as we are, then you should consider becoming a member of the .NET Foundation.
