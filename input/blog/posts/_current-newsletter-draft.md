## General news


## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### [Project Spotlight](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/spotlight)

Each month Project Spotlight shines a light on an interesting open source project and its maintainers. 




### New Projects
The .NET Foundation would like to welcome the following new projects!

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|TorchSharp|![NFLogo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/113320871-de42d080-92c7-11eb-895f-0d5028cc414c.png)|TorchSharp is a .NET library that provides access to the library that powers PyTorch. The focus is to bind the API surfaced by libtorch with a particular focus on tensors. The design intent is to stay as close as possible to the Pytorch experience, while still taking advantage of the benefits of the .NET static type system where it makes sense. For example: method overloading is relied on when Pytorch defines multiple valid types for a particular parameter.  The technology is a "wrapper library": no more, no less.|
|MQTTnet|![MQTTnet_logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/132379977-f081ed93-4047-4762-a053-2cfdf90023cd.png)|MQTTnet is a high performance .NET library for MQTT based communication. It provides a MQTT client and a MQTT server (broker).|
