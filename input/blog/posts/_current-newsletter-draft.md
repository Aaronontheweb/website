### DotVVM 4.0 and roadmap for DotVVM 5.0

We've published videos from [DotVVM Virtual Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAFYNAYbsE0&list=PLq1wAETqUjIa8ZHtBuNstZRVBlheO82Rg&index=1), an online event celebrating the release of [DotVVM 4.0](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/88/Released-DotVVM-4-0). 

We were talking about new features in DotVVM 4.0 - **composite controls**, **enhancements in C#-to-JavaScript translations**, some **new features in validation framework**, and much more. We also did some cool demos of **hosting DotVVM apps in MAUI** and presented a new generation of **DotVVM Dynamic Data**, a powerful library which auto-generates forms and grids based of your data models.
