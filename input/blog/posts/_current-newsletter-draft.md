## General news

* [**Calling all Maintainers - OSS Maintainer Support Survey**](https://seankilleen.com/2022/01/announcing-the-net-oss-maintainer-support-survey/): Sean Killeen ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/sjkilleen), [GitHub](https://github.com/SeanKilleen)) has created a survey to help identify ways maintainers and contributors would prefer to be supported and how supported they currently feel in each regard. He will share the aggregate data with the larger community and hopes this will help prioritize efforts to engage the community to support maintainers. If you maintain or contribute to an OSS project, [fill out the survey and make your voice heard](https://seankilleen.com/2022/01/announcing-the-net-oss-maintainer-support-survey/)!
