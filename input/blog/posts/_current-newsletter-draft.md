### New Releases


#### [DotVVM 3.0 Released](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/83/Released-DotVVM-3-0)

If you haven't heard about DotVVM yet - it's an MVVM framework which you can use to [build ASP.NET Core web apps with just C# and HTML]([DotVVM](https://www.dotvvm.com/build) or to [modernize legacy ASP.NET apps to .NET 5](https://www.dotvvm.com/modernize). DotVVM is based on Knockout JS, its download size is just about 60kB, and comes with a set of built-in UI controls.

**DotVVM 3.0** contains many improvements, and introduces several new features:

* Easier interaction with the page viewmodel from JS or TS code - you can import JS module in the page and call its functions from DotVVM data-bindings, and also call DotVVM commands from your JS code. It makes it easy to integrate any third-party JS library or component.
* Support for lambdas and variables in data-binding expressions - it's now easier to make client-side searching, ordering, or transform data returned from the server or REST API before it's passed in the viewmodel.

#### [NUnit](https://nunit.org)

[NUnit Analyzers 3.1 and 2.1](https://github.com/nunit/nunit.analyzers/releases/tag/3.1.0) are available. The 3.1 version continues to enhance the experience of using NUnit with the C# 8 Nullable Reference Types feature. (The 3.x versions have additional features that only work in Visual Studio 2019 and newer. The 2.x versions are available for those using Visual Studio 2017.)

[NUnit Adapter 4.0.0-beta.2](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/vs-test-adapter/Adapter-Release-Notes.html#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-400-beta2---april-6-2021) resolves some issues and improves performance. A major change in this version is the upgrade of the NUnit.Engine to version 3.12, and thus Mono.Cecil is no longer used. Instead it has a reduced version (based on Mono.Cecil) packed into TestCentric.engine.metadata doing the same job with navigation data.
